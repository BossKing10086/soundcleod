## What's SoundCleod?

SoundCleod is a Mac OS X application which brings
[SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com) to the
desktop without using a browser.

Why is that good?

- No more 'trying to find in which tab is SoundCloud running'..
- Media keys support! (Yeah, those with ▶ ❚❚ on them.)
- Stops on suspend.

## How to get it?

- [Download from
	here](https://github.com/salomvary/soundcleod/blob/master/dist/SoundCleod.zip?raw=true)
- Open the zip file.
- Move SoundCleod to the Applications folder.
- Go to Applications, find SoundCleod.
- Double click SoundCleod.
- If it greets with a prompt about an 'unidentified developer', do the
	following steps ([why is that?](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5290)):
	- Right click (or Control-click) SoundCleod
	- Select __Open__ from the menu
	- Click __Open__ in the dialog box.
	- If prompted, enter an administrator name and password.

## Screenshots? Yeah!
