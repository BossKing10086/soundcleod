## What's SoundCleod?

SoundCleod is a Mac OS X application which brings SoundCloud to the
desktop without using a browser.

Why is that good?

- No more 'trying to find in which tab is SoundCloud running'..
- Media keys support! (Yeah, those with ▶ ❚❚ on them.)
- Stops on suspend.

## Screenshots? Yeah!
