(Yeah, those with ▶ ❚❚ on them.)\r\n- Stops on suspend.\r\n\r\n## How to get it?\r\n\r\n- [Download from\r\n\there](https://github.com/salomvary/soundcleod/blob/master/dist/SoundCleod.zip?raw=true)\r\n- Open the zip file.\r\n- Move SoundCleod to the Applications folder.\r\n- Go to Applications, find SoundCleod.\r\n- Double click SoundCleod.\r\n- If it greets with a prompt about an 'unidentified developer', do the\r\n\tfollowing steps ([why is that?](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5290)):\r\n\t- Right click (or Control-click) SoundCleod\r\n\t- Select __Open__ from the menu\r\n\t- Click __Open__ in the dialog box.\r\n\t- If prompted, enter an administrator name and password.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots? Yeah!\r\n\r\n![SoundCleod screenshot](https://raw.github.com/salomvary/soundcleod/master/screenshot.png)\r\n\r\n## Disclaimer\r\n\r\nUse at your own risk. It might destroy the Earth.
